## Quantity
Serves 2-3
* 2 lbs chicken breast or thighs, cut into 3 inch pieces
* 0.5 onion
* 1 bell pepper

## Marinade

* 1 cup Greek Yogurt
* 4 cloves of garlic, minced
* 3 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* juice of half a medium lemon
* 1 teaspoon coriander
* 2 teaspoon cumin
* 2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1.5 teaspoon onion powder
* 0.5 teaspoon black pepper
* 1.5 teaspoon salt
* 0.25 teaspoon turmeric
* 0.25 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 0.25 teaspoon of cinnamon

## Roasted Garlic Sauce

* 0.75 cup coconut milk
* 2 teaspoon lemon juice
* 3-4 cloves roasted garlic
* salt, to taste

## Preparation

1. Prepare Marinade: In a large bowl combine all marinade ingredients. Add chicken to bowl and stir till coated. Cover and refrigerate for 4- 24 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Thread chicken, onion, and bell pepper onto skewers. Prop threaded skewers onto a foil lined baking sheet. It would be ideal if they weren’t touching the bottom of the pan.
3. Prepare Roasted Garlic Sauce. Pulse till smooth.
4. Drizzle the kebabs with olive oil before placing in the oven. Bake for 25 minutes. Turn the kabobs over and baste with drippings. Add another drizzle of olive oil and let cook for an addition 15 minutes. The kebabs should begin to char, but if not turn onto broil for 4 minutes. You must WATCH the chicken to make sure it doesn’t burn. Remove from oven and slice off the chicken, vertically.
5. Serve hot with drizzled with roasted garlic sauce
